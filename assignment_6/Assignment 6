1.Create a web server using express framework. Free to use any design pattern.(The project directory should have seperate folder for controller, routes, services, library)
Create an api which return a JWT token for the input received in req.body
Create an api which validates the token and return true or false
Create an api which takes number as input and return the first 10 multiple of tha number.
Create an api which takes a sentence as input and return an object which has alphabet/character (case insensitive) as key and occurrence as value.
Example: let's play
Output: {
l: 2,
e: 1,
t: 1,
s: 1,
p: 1,
a: 1,
y: 1,
!: 1,
â€˜: 1
};

Create an api, which check the number is armstrong or not. It should be get api where number should be passed as query parameter.


Note: All api should have validation implemented either using AJV or JOI.
	The last two api should have token validation apart from its main logic.Depending on token validation, main logic should be called.(hint: route based middleware design pattern)


2. Write down the integration and unit test cases for all the api.Integration testing should be done for controller and unit testing for services, so that code coverage is 100%.
Use mocha, chai/ sinon, nyc for the task.
